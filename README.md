### Prerequisites:

1. Anaconda Distribution
2. Jupyter NoteBook
3. Modules:
3a. OpenCV
3b. Dlib



## Five Point Facial Detection.

This part of the project detects the 5 specified Coordinates on the face.
2 Points on the each eye, and one for nose.
This task required a .dat file included in the repository by name **shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks**

## 68 Point Facial Landmark Detection:

This project similar to earlier process which is way more accurate and precise.
This part requires another file included in the repository **shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks**

There are some changes done in the code as the sysytem used is Windows Operating System and the code is written in Jupyter Notebook.

- Important: Original images have .jpeg extension and .jpg in detection images.

- The notebook contain the code for real time detection using WebCam as well.
- I have uploaded the webcam video of Landmark Detection as well.



This project is for educational purpose only.
